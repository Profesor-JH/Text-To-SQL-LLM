This project leverages the power of Language Model-based Text-to-SQL conversion to transform unstructured customer service dialogues into structured data and allows users to interact with this data using natural language queries.

## Features
1. **Text-to-SQL Conversion:** Automatically convert customer service dialogues into structured SQL database entries.
2. **Natural Language Queries:** Interact with the customer service database using intuitive natural language queries.
3. **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for processing dialogues and querying the database.


## Technical Details
1. **Text-to-SQL Conversion**
This project uses a fine-tuned language model to convert customer service dialogues into structured data and to generate SQL queries from natural language questions. The model is designed to handle function calling and dynamic query generation, making it highly adaptable to various query structures.

2. **Streamlit Interface**
The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the system. It allows users to process dialogues, input natural language queries, and view results in both raw and formatted tables.
